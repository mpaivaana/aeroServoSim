# APIS Aerodesign Team - Servo Motor Simulation with Arduino

## Description

This repository contains a project developed by the APIS Aerodesign Team, specifically by me, a member of the Electronics Team. The project focuses on simulating servo motors for the wing, rudder, and tail of an aircraft using Arduino.

## Project Overview

In the field of aerodesign, the efficient control of various aircraft components is crucial. Servo motors play a vital role in controlling the movement of surfaces such as the wing, rudder, and tail. The goal of this project is to develop a simulation that emulates the behavior of servo motors and their interaction with the respective aircraft surfaces.

## Getting Started

To run the servo motor simulation, you will need the following:

- Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment)
- Arduino board
- Servo motors (corresponding to the wing, rudder, and tail)

Please follow these steps:

1. Connect the Arduino board to your computer.
2. Open the Arduino IDE.
3. Load the Arduino code for the desired component.
4. Verify and upload the code to the Arduino board.
5. Connect the appropriate servo motor(s) to the Arduino board.
6. Power on the Arduino board.
